My Name is Javier Amaro and I am originally from San Mateo, California. This summer my family moved to South Carolina so I am also from there now.
some things that I like doing are playing video games, watching anime, hanging out with my friends, and doing stuff related to nature. Two fun facts about
me is that my birthday is on Star Wars day and my favorite animal is the red panda. Some of my favorite games are Ark : Survival Evolved, Terraria, 
Armored Core 6, and sometimes League of Legends.

Things I hope to learn through this course
<ol>
    <li>I want to learn how to best succeed in learning to be a software engineer</li>
    <li>I want to learn the skills needed for when I work as a software engineer, that aren't just coding</li>
    <li>I want to learn about the experience and general overview of working as a software engineer for a company </li>
</ol>
